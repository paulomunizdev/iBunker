# iBunker 1.0 - Encrypt and Decrypt Files

iBunker is a command-line tool designed to provide encryption and decryption functionality for various types of files, offering users a secure way to protect sensitive information. With iBunker, you can encrypt your files using a strong key automatically generated by the program or provide your own password for decryption.

## Features

- Encrypt files using a strong automatically generated key.
- Decrypt files using a provided password.
- Simple command-line interface for easy usage.
- Cross-platform compatibility.

## Usage

### Encryption

To encrypt a file, use the following command:

```
./ibunker encrypt input_file output_file
```

This command will generate a strong key automatically and use it to encrypt the contents of the `input_file`, saving the encrypted data to `output_file`.

### Decryption

To decrypt a file, use the following command:

```
./ibunker decrypt input_file output_file password
```

Replace `input_file` with the path to the encrypted file, `output_file` with the desired name for the decrypted file, and `password` with the password used for encryption.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/paulomunizdev/iBunker.git
    ```

2. Compile the program:
    ```
    g++ -o ibunker ibunker.cpp
    ```

3. Run the program as described in the Usage section.

## How iBunker Works

### Encryption:

1. **Generating a Strong Key:**
   - The `generateStrongKey()` function is responsible for generating a random strong key with high entropy.
   - This key is essential for the security of the encryption process and consists of 32 randomly chosen characters, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits.

2. **Converting the Key to Numeric Form:**
   - The generated key is converted to its numeric representation using the `convertKey()` function.
   - Each character of the key is mapped to its corresponding value in the ASCII table, resulting in a sequence of integers.

3. **Encrypting the Text:**
   - During the encryption process, the original text is traversed character by character.
   - Each character is numerically shifted based on the corresponding value of the key at that position.
   - This shift is performed by adding the ASCII value of the original character to the numeric value corresponding to the key.
   - The result of this shift is stored as a new character in the output file, producing the encrypted text.

### Decryption:

1. **Converting the Key to Numeric Form:**
   - When the process is decryption, the key provided by the user is converted to its numeric form in the same way as in encryption.

2. **Decrypting the Text:**
   - During decryption, the encrypted text is traversed character by character.
   - Each character is numerically shifted back using the corresponding value of the key at that position.
   - This shift is performed by subtracting the numeric value of the key from the ASCII value of the encrypted character.
   - The result of this shift is stored as a new character in the output file, resulting in the original text before encryption.

### Modular Arithmetic:

- Throughout the encryption and decryption process, modular arithmetic is applied.
- Modular arithmetic is used to ensure that the resulting values remain within the valid range of printable ASCII characters (0 to 255).
- This operation is performed by calculating the remainder of the division of the resulting value by 256, ensuring that the encrypted and decrypted characters are within the valid ASCII range.
