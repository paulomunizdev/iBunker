# iBunker 2.1 - Encrypt and Decrypt Files

iBunker is a command-line tool designed to provide encryption and decryption functionality for various types of files, offering users a secure way to protect sensitive information. With iBunker, you can encrypt your files using a strong key automatically generated by the program or provide your own password for decryption.

## Security

- iBunker uses AES-256 encryption, a military-grade encryption standard approved by the NSA (National Security Agency).

## Features

- Encrypt files using AES encryption algorithm.
- Decrypt files using AES decryption algorithm.
- Simple command-line interface for easy usage.
- Cross-platform compatibility.

## How iBunker Works

### Encryption:

1. **Generating the Key:**
   - During encryption, iBunker internally generates a strong encryption key using a secure 256-bit key generator.

2. **Encrypting the Text:**
   - Using the AES encryption algorithm, the program encrypts the contents of the `<input_file>`.

3. **Saving the Result:**
   - The encrypted data is saved to `<output_file>`.

### Decryption:

1. **Reading the Key:**
   - The program reads the decryption key from the specified `<key_file>`.

2. **Decrypting the Text:**
   - Using the AES decryption algorithm, the program decrypts the contents of the `<input_file>`.

3. **Saving the Result:**
   - The decrypted data is saved to `<output_file>`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/paulomunizdev/iBunker.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the iBunker directory:
    ```bash
    cd iBunker
    ```

3. Compile the program:
    ```bash
    g++ -o ibunker ibunker.cpp -lcryptopp
    ```

### Dependencies

Ensure that the Crypto++ library is installed on your system. If not, you can install it by following these steps:

```bash
# Update repositories
sudo apt-get update

# Install the Crypto++ library
sudo apt-get install libcrypto++-dev
```

## Example

To encrypt a file named `plaintext.txt` using a key stored in `key.txt` and save the encrypted data to `encrypted.txt`, you would run:

```bash
./ibunker encrypt plaintext.txt encrypted.txt key.txt
```

To decrypt `encrypted.txt` using the same key and save the decrypted data to `decrypted.txt`, you would run:

```bash
./ibunker decrypt encrypted.txt decrypted.txt key.txt
```

## Note

- It is crucial to handle the key securely. Keep the key file (`key.txt`) safe and do not share it with unauthorized users.
