# iBunker 1.0 - Encrypt and Decrypt Files

iBunker is a command-line tool designed to provide encryption and decryption functionality for various types of files, offering users a secure way to protect sensitive information. With SafeText, you can encrypt your files using a strong key automatically generated by the program or provide your own password for decryption.

## Features

- Encrypt files using a strong automatically generated key.
- Decrypt files using a provided password.
- Simple command-line interface for easy usage.
- Cross-platform compatibility.

## Usage

### Encryption

To encrypt a file, use the following command:

```
./ibunker encrypt input_file output_file
```

This command will generate a strong key automatically and use it to encrypt the contents of the `input_file`, saving the encrypted data to `output_file`.

### Decryption

To decrypt a file, use the following command:

```
./ibunker decrypt input_file output_file password
```

Replace `input_file` with the path to the encrypted file, `output_file` with the desired name for the decrypted file, and `password` with the password used for encryption.
